## Signups now open

Last week we announced our new course, [From Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion](https://www.fast.ai/posts/part2-2022.html), which is part 2 of our Practical Deep Learning for Coders series. Part 1 of the course, which is [available now](https://course.fast.ai/) is a free course designed for people with some coding experience, who want to learn how to apply deep learning and machine learning to practical problems. Part 2 will be an in-depth course that starts from the foundations---implementing and GPU-optimising matrix multiplications and initialisations---and goes all the way through to implementing the astounding [Stable Diffusion](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-public-release) algorithm (and many other papers along the way).
