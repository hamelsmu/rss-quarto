    "text": "Signups now open\nLast week we announced our new course, From Deep Learning Foundations to Stable Diffusion, which is part 2 of our Practical Deep Learning for Coders series. Part 1 of the course, which is available now is a free course designed for people with some coding experience, who want to learn how to apply deep learning and machine learning to practical problems. Part 2 will be an in-depth course that starts from the foundations—implementing and GPU-optimising matrix multiplications and initialisations—and goes all the way through to implementing the astounding Stable Diffusion algorithm (and many other papers along the way)."
